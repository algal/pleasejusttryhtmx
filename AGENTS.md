The purpose of this project is to build a single page website, which will live on the domain https://pleasejustryhtmx.com

It will advocate for HTMX, in a pugnacious, opinionanted, but factual and informative style.

It will be in the style of these websites, which advocate for

- https://motherfuckingwebsite.com
- https://justfuckingusehtml.com
- http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com
- https://justfuckingusereact.com

The pleasejusttryhtmx site will be, in effect, in reply or in dialog in allusion to them. 


You can learn about HTMX from:

- htmx site: https://htmx.org
- the hypermedia systems book: https://hypermedia.systems

Please review these four sites and spend some time collecting notes about the pattern in their style ad content.

Please also review the material on htmx in depth.

take as much time as you need. be creative! be thorough! 

Then summarize those notes here, outlining a plan for pleasejusttry, before we build it.
